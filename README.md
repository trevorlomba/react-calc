# Scientific Calculator by Trevor Lomba

A scientific calculator built using React and SCSS as a sequel to my basic jQuery calculator. This calculator employs efficient logic including field look-ups to streamline the handling of user input. Unlike my basic calculator, this application leverages mathJS to handle the calculations. State is used to keep track of answers, operands and operators as well as the number of open parenthesis and other details necessary to validate inputs and guarantee functionality.

Known bugs include errors with calculating certain operations related to input validation. Future iterations will include event listeners for keyboard inputs, input validation for security and functionality, and buttons for additional scientific calculations.
